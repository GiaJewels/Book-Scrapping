📊 Web Scraping & Data Analysis for E-Commerce Insights

Project Overview

This project focuses on extracting, cleaning, and analyzing e-commerce product data to generate meaningful business insights. The goal is to simulate a real-world data analytics workflow, covering the full data lifecycle from web scraping to insight-driven recommendations and presentation.

Using Python, I collected product data from free-to-scrape e-commerce sources, processed and cleaned the dataset, performed exploratory data analysis (EDA), and summarized findings in a clear and professional format. This project demonstrates practical skills in web scraping, data cleaning, data visualization, and analytical reporting.
